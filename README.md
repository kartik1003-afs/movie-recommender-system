# Movie Recommender System

A Streamlit-powered web application that provides personalized movie recommendations. Leveraging collaborative filtering and content-based methods, this project demonstrates how machine learning and interactive web apps can enhance user experience in discovering new films.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Receive movie suggestions tailored to your preferences.
- **Search & Filter:** Search for movies by title, genre, or release year.
- **User Ratings:** Input your ratings to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Interactive Interface:** Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for seamless user interaction.
- **Visualization:** Explore data trends and user/movie profiles with interactive visualizations.
